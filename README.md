# QuickSort
This program is a quicksort for any number of lines from a file. It will read each line as a string and sort each line. For example, if one line says "Bring me food" and another says "Around the house," it will be sorted as "Around the house" then "Bring me food." It is also case sensitive so capital letter lines will come before lowercase lines.
